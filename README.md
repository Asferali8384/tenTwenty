🔷 Project Overview

This project enables users to log in and add notes in real time. All data is securely stored in a MongoDB database, and routes are protected with authentication. Key features include:

🔐 Authentication: Users can only access their own notes; unauthorized access is blocked.

📂 Protected Routes: If not logged in, users are restricted from accessing any protected URLs.

📋 Notes Feature: Users can create and manage notes dynamically.

📅 Dynamic Dashboard: Weeks are calculated dynamically based on the stored data.

💻 UI/UX: Simple, functional, and slightly responsive UI.

⚙️ Pending Work: A few minor features are pending due to time constraints.
